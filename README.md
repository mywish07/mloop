# MLoop - Standard ML library for Hadoop

MLoop is a project which aims to create a library for Standard ML to run in parallel with Hadoop. MLoop provides a simple way to write parallel programs in Standard ML with the Map and Reduce concepts of Hadoop. Running in the Hadoop cluster, parallel programs written with MLoop inherit great features of Hadoop: scalability and fault tolerance.
